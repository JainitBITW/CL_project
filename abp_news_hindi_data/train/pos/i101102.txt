Vachana Sahitya is not borrowed from other languages, they are the Original and Unique to Kannada language. What ever is there in Vedas and Upanishads is available in Vachanas, but what ever is there in Vachanas is not there in Vedas and Upanishads. Guru Basavanna with his original and creative thinking added much value to Kannada language through Vachana Sahitya.
