The Julian calendar was introduced in 45 BC replacing the earlier Roman calendar. In the Julian calendar as in the Gregorian calendar an ordinary year is 365 days long and a leap year is 366 days long. The difference is which years are leap years. In the Julian calendar every fourth year is a leap year. The Gregorian calendar uses a more complex algorithm to more closely approximate the length of the tropical year.
