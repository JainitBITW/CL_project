CSS 2, SVG and CSS 2.1 also allow web authors to use so-called system colors, which are color names whose values are taken from the operating system. This enables web authors to style their content in line with the operating system of the user agent. As of early 2004, it appears that the CSS3 color module will once again drop these values, marking them deprecated, but this may change.
