A fourth century legend, often told to explain the birth of Chilika, states that the pirate king, Raktabahhu, planned to attack Puri with a huge fleet of ships. To avoid detection, he stealthily anchored out of sight, off the mouth to the sea. The deception was revealed by ships' refuse floating to the shore, thus warning the townâ€™s people, who escaped with all their possessions. Raktabahu felt betrayed when he found an abandoned town and directed his fury towards the seathat had betrayed him. The sea parted to let the army march in, then surged back, drowned the army and formed the present lake.
