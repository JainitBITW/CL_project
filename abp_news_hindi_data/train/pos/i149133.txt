A 2.1 kHz allocation, the 136 kHz band, is available to amateur radio operators in some countries in Europe, New Zealand and French overseas dependencies. The world record distance for a two-way contact is over 10,000 km from near Vladivostok to New Zealand. As well as conventional Morse code many operators use very slow computer controlled Morse code or specialized digital communications modes. A proposal at the WRC-07 World Radiocommunication Conference aims to make this a worldwide amateur radio allocation.
