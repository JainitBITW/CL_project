Lebanon-based Arabic-language daily al-Diyar said in a report that the convoy of Prince Mohammad bin Salman Al Saud which consisting of 200 army forces and 150 police officers and were escorting the prince, played a central role in the stampede. The report said the presence of the prince in the middle of the population prompted a change in the direction of the movement of the pilgrims and a stampede. The report further said that Salman and his huge entourage swiftly abandoned the scene, adding that the Saudi authorities seek to hush up the entire story and impose a media blackout on Salmanâ€™s presence in the area.
