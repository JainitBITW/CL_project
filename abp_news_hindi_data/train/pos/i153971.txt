"What´s special about her performances as Meenakshi Iyer is not the effort she put into it as much as the apparent lack of it. Be it her squabbling with the urbane photographer Jehangir Chaudhary or her gently reprimanding him about how her name is pronounced or even when she is screaming at her infant, you believe it´s Meenakshi you´ve met. And therein lies the key to her iconic performance."
