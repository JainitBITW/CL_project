Rain occurs mainly in the winter and spring months, with great annual variations in storm severity. Los Angeles averages 15 inches of precipitation per year. Tornado warnings are also issued, which are extraordinarily rare downtown, though waterspouts are seen during severe storms at beaches. Snow is extraordinarily rare in the city basin, but the mountainous slopes within city limits typically receive snow every year. The greatest snowfall recorded in downtown Los Angeles was 2.0 inches on January 15, 1932.
