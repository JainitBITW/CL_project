Given the variety of modelling tasks, there is not one common data format that has developed.For describing the layout of an accelerator and the corresponding elements, one uses a so-called "lattice file".There have been numerous attempts at unifying the lattice file formats used in different codes. One unification attempt is the Accelerator Markup Language, and the Universal Accelerator Parser. Another attempt at a unified approach to accelerator codes is the UAL or Universal Accelerator Library.
