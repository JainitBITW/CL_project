The Republic of China has once again recognized the statehood of wikt:Mongolia in 2002, thus freezing the territorial claim, but as the Constitution of the Republic of China still mentions Mongolia in Article 119 that has not been superseded by the Additional Articles of the Constitution of the Republic of China, there are different opinions as to whether such a recognition is constitutional. Despite these, the Yearbook of the Republic of China 2003 Version published by the wikt:Government Information Office does claim Outer Mongolia.
