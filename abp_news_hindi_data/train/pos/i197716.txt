'In addition to free information, there's a lot of free software on the Internet today, some of it quite useful. Sometimes it's commercial software given away as part of a marketing campaign. Other times the software has been written as a graduate student project or at a government-funded lab. But I think consumer desire for quality, support, and comprehensiveness in important software applications means that the demand for commercial software will continue to grow. Already many of the students and faculty members who wrote free software at their universities are busy writing business plans for start-up companies that will provide commercial versions of their software with more features, not to mention customer support and maintenance.'
