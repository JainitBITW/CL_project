The wikt:Antarctic Treaty System, formed on wikt:1 December wikt:1959 and entered into force on wikt:23 June wikt:1961, establishes the legal framework for the management of wikt:Antarctica and provides administration for the continent, which is carried out through consultative member meetings. It freezes the territorial claims of all signatories for as long as the treaty is in force. However, it is not a final settlement; parties can choose to withdraw from the System at any time. Furthermore, only a minority of states have signed it, and it is not formally sanctioned by the wikt:United Nations. Thus, Antarctica remains the only part of the planet any state can still lay claim to as wikt:terra nullius .
