Adult caracals dwell either alone or, less commonly, in pairs. Females inhabit relatively small home ranges, varying from 5 से 57 वर्ग किलोमीटर, depending on the local availability of prey. While the females actively defend their territory against other females, the males roam over much larger areas of 19 से 220 वर्ग किलोमीटर with considerable overlap.
