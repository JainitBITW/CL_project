This statement is equivalent to a conservation of four-current. In the mid-nineteenth century, James Clerk Maxwell postulated the existence of electromagnetic waves as a result of his discovery that Ampère's law was inconsistent with the conservation of charge. After correctly reformulating Ampère's law, Maxwell also realized that such waves would travel at the speed of light, and that light itself must be a form of electromagnetic radiation. See electromagnetic wave equation for a full discussion of these discoveries.
