The UK allocated a 2.8 kHz sliver of spectrum from 71.6 kHz to 74.4 kHz beginning in April 1996 to UK amateurs who applied for a Notice of Variation to use the band on a noninterference basis with a maximum output power of 1 W ERP . This was withdrawn on 30 जून 2003 after a number of extensions in favor of the European-harmonized 136 kHz band. A 1-watt transmission of very slow Morse Code between G3AQC and W1TAG spanned the Atlantic Ocean for 3275 miles on November 21-22, 2001.
