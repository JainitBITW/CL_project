Using dimensional analysis, it is possible combine fundamental physical constants to produce basic units of measurement. Depending on the choice and arrangement of constants used, the resulting natural units may have physical meaning. For example, Planck units use   c, G, ℏ, ε 0   {\displaystyle c,G,\hbar ,\varepsilon _{0}} and   k  {\displaystyle k} to derive constants relevant to unified theories, including quantum gravity.
