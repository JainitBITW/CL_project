नोकिया is working toward the future of phones and mobile communication devices with their new concept phone, the नोकिया "Scentsory". This new mobile device uses the sense of smell, sight, hearing, and touch to create a multiscensory environment for the caller. Scentsory would be able to detect, send, and emit smells, as well as radiate colors, lighting, and temperature from the environment of the caller. Dual screens can be used for personal video messaging as well as watching videos.
