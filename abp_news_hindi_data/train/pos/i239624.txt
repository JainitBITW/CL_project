In addition to drinking water, VOCs are regulated in discharges to waters, as hazardous waste, but not in non industrial indoor air. The United States Department of Labor and its Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulate VOC exposure in the workplace. Volatile organic compounds that are hazardous material would be regulated by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration while being transported.
