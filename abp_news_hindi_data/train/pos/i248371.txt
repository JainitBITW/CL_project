OM may my organs, speech, Prana, eyes and ears be nourished and be well, so should all senses become strong. Upanishad says all this is Brahman. I don't reject Brahman, may Brahma not reject me. Let there be no rejection, let there be no rejection at all in me, let me be concentrated on Self, all those ways of righteous living told in Upanishads be in me! Be in me, OM Peace, Peace, Peace.
