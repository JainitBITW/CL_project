The purpose of the color comparison chart is, by arranging the tints and shades of a particular color in approximate order from lightest at the top to most saturated in the middle to darkest at the bottom, to allow the Wikipedia user to more easily choose a color they may need for a particular use. Having the colors arranged by shade rather than alphabetically makes it easier to do this.
