The 5510 was नोकिया's first phone with a built in MP3 player, and it had 64 megabytes of memory for storing MP3s. It also had a full QWERTY keyboard and an 84 x 48 मोनोक्रोम display. This phone did not sell very well even though it was advertised on television, possibly because it was too expensive and too big. Its replacement is the नोकिया 3300.
