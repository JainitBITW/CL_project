Nalaban Island: The 15 km2 Nalaban Island is within the Lagoon and is the core area of the Ramsar designated wetlands. It was declared a bird sanctuary under the Wildlife Protection Act in 1973. Itâ€™s the heart of the park where one can seen thousands of birds descending during the migratory season.
