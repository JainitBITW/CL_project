The 5210 features rubber Xpress-On shells, WAP over CSD and a built in thermometer. The thermometer is actually the internal temperature of the phone's battery, this feature is also present on other phones that have "netmonitor" enabled. The 5210 is nicknamed a "builder's phone" because of its rubber splash/impact proof casing. Its successor is the 5100 and after that, the 5140 and 5140i.
