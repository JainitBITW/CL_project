The 7110 was the first नोकिया phone with a WAP browser. WAP was significantly hyped up during the 1998-2000 Internet boom. However WAP did not meet these expectations and uptake was limited. Another industry first was the flap, which slid from beneath the phone with a push from the release button. Unfortunately the cover was not too durable. The 7110 was also the only phone to feature a navi-roller key.
