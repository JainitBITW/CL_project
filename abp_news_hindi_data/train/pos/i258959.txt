OM let my speech be established in mind, and mind be established in my speech, May Brahman reveal itself to me! May I be able to grasp the truths of the Vedas! Let not what I have heard forsake me! May I spend both day and night in study! I say rta, I'll say the Truth; may that protect me! May that protect the teacher! May it protect me; and may it protect the speaker as well!OM Peace, Peace, Peace.
