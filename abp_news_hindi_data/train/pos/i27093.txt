Note: Just as the photon, Z बोसॉन and W± bosons are superpositions of the B0, W0, W1, and W2 fields – the फोटिनो, zino, and wino± are superpositions of the bino0, wino0, wino1, and wino2 by definition.No matter if one uses the original gauginos or this superpositions as a basis, the only predicted physical particles are न्यूट्र्लिनोs और चार्जिनोs as a superposition of them together with the Higgsinos.
