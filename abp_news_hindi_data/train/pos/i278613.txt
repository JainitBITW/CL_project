The strong odor emitted by many plants consists of green leaf volatiles, a subset of VOCs. Emissions are affected by a variety of factors, such as temperature, which determines rates of volatilization and growth, and sunlight, which determines rates of biosynthesis. Emission occurs almost exclusively from the leaves, the stomata in particular. A major class of VOCs is terpenes, such as myrcene. Providing a sense of scale, a forest 62,000 km2 in area is estimated to emit 3,400,000 kilograms of terpenes on a typical August day during the growing season. VOCs should be a factor in choosing which trees to plant in urban areas. Induction of genes producing volatile organic compounds, and subsequent increase in volatile terpenes has been achieved in maize using -3-Hexen-1-ol and other plant hormones.
