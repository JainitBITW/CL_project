This configuration employs negative feedback to prevent thermal runaway and stabilize the operating point. In this form of biasing, the base resistor   R b   {\displaystyle R_{\text{b}}} is connected to the collector instead of connecting it to the DC source   V cc   {\displaystyle V_{\text{cc}}} . So any thermal runaway will induce a voltage drop across the   R C   {\displaystyle R_{\text{C}}} resistor that will throttle the transistor's base current.
