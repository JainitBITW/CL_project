If   V be   {\displaystyle V_{\text{be}}} is held constant and temperature increases, then the collector current   I c   {\displaystyle I_{\text{c}}} increases. However, a larger   I c   {\displaystyle I_{\text{c}}} causes the voltage drop across resistor   R c   {\displaystyle R_{\text{c}}} to increase, which in turn reduces the voltage   V  R  b    {\displaystyle V_{{\text{R}}_{\text{b}}}} across the base resistor   R b   {\displaystyle R_{\text{b}}} . A lower base-resistor voltage drop reduces the base current   I b   {\displaystyle I_{\text{b}}}, which results in less collector current   I c   {\displaystyle I_{\text{c}}} . Because an increase in collector current with temperature is opposed, the operating point is kept stable.
