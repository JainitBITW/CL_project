The standard voltage divider circuit discussed above faces a drawback â€“ AC feedback caused by resistor RE reduces the gain. This can be avoided by placing a capacitor in parallel with Re, as shown in circuit diagram. The result is that the DC operating point is well controlled, while the AC-gain is much higher, rather than the much lower value of   R c  /  R e   {\displaystyle R_{\text{c}}/R_{\text{e}}} without the capacitor.
