Class B and AB amplifiers employ 2 active devices to cover the complete 360 deg of input signal flow. Each transistor is therefore biased to perform over approximately 180 deg of the input signal. Class B bias is when the collector current Ic with no signal is just conducting . Class-AB bias is when the collector current Ic is about 1/4 of maximum possible value.The class-AB pushâ€“pull output amplifier circuit below could be the basis for a moderate-power audio amplifier.
