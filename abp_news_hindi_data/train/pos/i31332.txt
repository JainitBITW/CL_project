By 1935, about one third of Buryat datsans was emptied because the clergy had either fled or been repressed. A year later, 22 of 29 datsans were closed down under the pretext that they were situated near the state border, and lamas were expelled, accused of being ‘Japanese spies’ and ‘the people’s enemies’. Similar actions were taking place in Kalmykia, as well as in formally independent Tuva.
