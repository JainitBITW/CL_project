Sons of Ind, why sit ye idle,Wait ye for some Deva's aid?Buckle to, be up and doing!Nations by themselves are made!Yours the land, lives, all, at stake, thoNot by you the cards are played;Are ye dumb? Speak up and claim them!By themselves are nations made!What avail your wealth, your learning,Empty titles, sordid trade?True self-rule were worth them all!Nations by themselves are made!Whispered murmurs darkly creeping,Hidden worms beneath the glade,Not by such shall wrong be righted!Nations by themselves are made!Are ye Serfs or are ye Freemen,Ye that grovel in the shade?In your own hands rest the issues!By themselves are nations made!Sons of Ind, be up and doing,Let your course by none be stayed;Lo! the Dawn is in the East;By themselves are nations made!
