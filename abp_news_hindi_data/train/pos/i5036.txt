From the two identities above, the following table can be extrapolated. Note however that these conversion equations may not provide the correct sign . For example, if sin θ = 1/2, the conversion in the table indicates that   cos ⁡ θ =  1 − sin 2  ⁡ θ  =  3  / 2  {\displaystyle \scriptstyle \cos \theta \,=\,{\sqrt {1-\sin ^{2}\theta }}={\sqrt {3}}/2}, though it is possible that   cos ⁡ θ = −  3  / 2  {\displaystyle \scriptstyle \cos \theta \,=\,-{\sqrt {3}}/2} . More information would be needed about which quadrant θ lies in to determine a single, exact answer.
