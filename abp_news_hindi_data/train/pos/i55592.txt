Kalmyk Buddhism of that period had its own story. After the Kalmyk Khanate elimination in the end of the 18th century, the ‘Steppe of Kalmykia’ became another territory of the tsarist Russia, subjected to the military governor of Astrakhan. According to the Royal Regulation on Governing Kalmyk People legislated in 1834, the Buddhist church was completely under authority of the tsar administration.
