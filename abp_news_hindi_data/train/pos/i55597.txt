In Tuva, an ‘independent’ state since 1921, the church at first remained untouched. In 1928, the national parliament even legislated Buddhism as a state religion. Perhaps this provoked the devastation to begin in 1929, which was enforced in 1930 by the Communist Party’s special resolution on ‘the problem of lamas’. According to the witnesses, lamas were arrested methodically, the top echelon of the clergy at first, then the next ‘layer’, and so on to the very last.
