Since certain loans and bonds may commonly be quoted in relation to some index or underlying security, they will often be quoted as a spread over the index. For example, a loan that bears interest of 0.50% per annum above the London Interbank Offered Rate is said to be 50 basis points over LIBOR, which is commonly expressed as "L+50bps" or simply "L+50".
